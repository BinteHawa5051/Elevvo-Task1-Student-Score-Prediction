# Student Score Prediction

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways.  
The goal of this task was to predict studentsâ€™ exam scores using regression techniques.

## Project Description
- Dataset: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)
- Objective: Predict students' exam scores based on study hours and related factors
- Steps Performed:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Basic data visualization to understand dataset patterns
  - Train-test split of the dataset
  - Built a Linear Regression model to predict final exam scores
  - Visualized predictions and evaluated model performance

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Covered Topics
- Regression (Supervised Learning)
- Evaluation Metrics for regression models
